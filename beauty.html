    <p class="text-justify">Fast food is a type of food that is prepared and served within a few minutes. It is very convenient to buy it when you are busy and want to eat on the move running to the important meeting. As usually, there are proponents and opponents of such a convenience food. Of course, this so-called street food has its advantages and disadvantages. To pros, I would include the fact that it can spare the time of a lot of working mothers and fathers, who cannot find the time even to take a shower, to say nothing about the proper meal. There are also people, who travel on business and do not want to leave the car. The only thing they need to do is to approach a drive-through window and place an order. No need to browse a vast menu and wait for hours. The prices in such places are also very loyal due to the high-level competition. They also make their portions bigger in order to land customers and remain in the market.Some people are not in favor of eating and drinking in strange places. They are also afraid of getting sick during the vacation. The only way out for them during the trips is to find the outlet of the chain of restaurants, where the standards of quality are the same. It is always better to sneak something than just leave your body without any nourishment for more than six hours thus slowing your metabolism and spoiling the digestion for the whole life.For people, who care about their weight, shape and always count calories, these restaurants have already come up with special offers. Now we can find vast varieties of salads on their menus, pasta from durum wheat flour, which is high in protein and strong gluten and fruit smoothies. The salad dressing is optional as well. But on the other hand, who can resist an impulse to buy a juicy burger and opt for the low-fat salad looking at the billboards near the restaurants? Regular consuming of such calorie dense foods can result in quick weight gain. It increases the risk of developing diabetes, atherosclerosis, high blood pressure and a lot of other obesity-related diseases. Despite the fact the standards of sanitary requirements are extremely high, it is difficult to control everything due to the very large scale of products that are being prepared.</p>
